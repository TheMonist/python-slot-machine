This is a Slot Machine Game made for the console. A slot machine is a gambling machine that generates a random sequence of charaters. The goal is to place a bet and have the slot machine spin. If you have three matching characters you win a payout.

Every player starts the game with a balance of $100 dollars and they have the opportunity to place a bet from this balance until it reaches 0.

- If you spin three Cherries 🍒, you get three times your bet and will be added to the balance.
- If you spin three Watermelons 🍉, you get four times your bet and will be added to the balance.
- If you spin three Lemons 🍋, you get five times your betand will be added to the balance.
- If you spin three Bells 🛎️, you get ten times your bet and will be added to the balance.
- If you spin three Stars ⭐️, you get twenty times and will be added to the balance.
- If you do not get three in a row, your bet gets deducted from your balance.

I did this project for Code in Place 2024. Code In Place is a six week online course at Stanford University that teaches the fundamentals of the Python programming language. This final project is a showcase of what I learned in Python over the past six weeks.
